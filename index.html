    <h1>CrossFire 6.0f8: Status Update</h1>

    <p>We anticipate the official launch of this website in the near future **(2025/2026)**.</p>

    <p>The BCAS Team has been diligently working on significant new updates, and we sincerely apologize for the time investment required to reach this stage of development.</p>

    <div class="update-section">
        <h3>Current Development Focus: New Modules</h3>
        <p>Our primary focus is currently directed toward the development of **five new, highly useful modules** for the CrossFire ecosystem.</p>
        
        <p>Specifically, **PaL-HyperSecure** has been in **mass development recently**. We are prioritizing its thorough refinement, and while significant progress has been made, we anticipate it may take another few months until it is ready for a stable public release.</p>
    </div>

    <p>Furthermore, we are actively seeking collaboration with other development groups to assist us in our endeavor to create the **Ultimate Universal Package Manager**.</p>
